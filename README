Just some of my random applications and Projects that I have done in my Masters.

RailsPress: Ruby on Rails web application for creating your own one page ebusiness card

RailsPress Gem: Installable Gem that allows you to create your ebusiness card locally from
the preferences you have specified in the web app.

CoffeScript: Any and all CoffeScript Scripts

MeteorApps: All the apps I have created using the Meteor JS Frameworks.
